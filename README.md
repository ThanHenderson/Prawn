# prawn

Rust game based on the Pong tutorial in the Amethyst Game Engine book (https://book.amethyst.rs/). Exactly like Pong except the paddles are prawns and the ball is a pearl. I did this small project to help my understanding of how Rust works and try out Amethyst. I am still making small improvements and will be adding a pause state, a loading screen and whatnot. 

## How to run

To run the game, use

```
cargo run --features "vulkan"
```

on Windows and Linux, and

```
cargo run --features "metal"
```

on macOS.
